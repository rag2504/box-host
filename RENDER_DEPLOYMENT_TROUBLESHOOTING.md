# Render Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issue: Deployment Stuck at Building/Deploying Stage

Your Render deployment is currently stuck at the building/deploying stage. Based on the logs and code analysis, we've identified and fixed several potential issues:

## Fixed Issues

1. **Port Configuration Mismatch**:
   - The `render.yaml` file was configured to use port `10000`
   - The server code uses `process.env.PORT || 3001`
   - We've updated `render.yaml` to use port `3001` to match the server code

2. **Node.js Version**:
   - Your `package.json` already correctly specifies Node.js version 18.x in the `engines` field
   - Note that Node.js 18.x has reached end-of-life according to the deployment logs
   - Consider upgrading to a maintained version (e.g., 20.x) in the future

## Deployment Health Check

The health check endpoint at `/api/health` is correctly defined in your server code and `render.yaml`, but it's currently returning a "Not Found" error when accessed at `https://boxcric-api.onrender.com/api/health`. This suggests the server isn't running properly or the deployment hasn't completed successfully.

## Next Steps

1. **Trigger a New Deployment**:
   - Go to your Render dashboard
   - Navigate to the `boxcric-api` service
   - Click "Manual Deploy" and select "Deploy latest commit"

2. **Monitor Deployment Logs**:
   - Watch the logs during deployment for any errors
   - Pay attention to the startup phase after the build completes

3. **Check Environment Variables**:
   - Verify all required environment variables are set in the Render dashboard
   - Particularly check `MONGODB_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, and Cashfree credentials

4. **Verify MongoDB Connection**:
   - Ensure your MongoDB Atlas instance is running and accessible
   - Check if there are any IP restrictions that might block Render's servers

## Common Render Deployment Issues

1. **Binding to Wrong Host**:
   - Your server correctly binds to `0.0.0.0` in production, which is good
   - Never bind to `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` on Render as it won't be externally accessible

2. **Health Check Failures**:
   - Render uses the health check to verify your app is running
   - The endpoint must return a status code between 200-399
   - If health checks fail, Render may restart your service repeatedly

3. **Memory or Resource Limits**:
   - Free tier services have limited resources
   - Check if your app is exceeding memory limits during startup

4. **Long Startup Time**:
   - Render may time out if your app takes too long to start
   - Consider optimizing startup time or increasing the service's startup timeout

## Using the Fix Script

We've created a diagnostic script `fix-render-deployment.js` that can help identify and fix common deployment issues. Run it with:

```bash
node fix-render-deployment.js
```

This script will:
- Check your `render.yaml` configuration
- Verify server port and host settings
- Fix common configuration issues
- Provide a deployment checklist

## Contact Render Support

If you continue to experience issues after trying these solutions, consider contacting Render support through your dashboard. They can provide specific insights about your deployment.
