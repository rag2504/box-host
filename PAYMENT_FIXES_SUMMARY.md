# Payment Logic Fixes Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **Incorrect TimeSlot Parameter in getPricing Function**
**Problem**: The `getPricing` function was being called with a string timeSlot (e.g., "10:00-12:00") but expected an object with `startTime` and `duration` properties.

**Location**: `server/routes/bookings.js` lines 208, 643, 692

**Fix**: Updated all calls to `getPricing` to pass the correct object format:
```javascript
// Before
getPricing(ground, timeSlot)

// After  
getPricing(ground, { startTime, endTime, duration })
```

### 2. **Incorrect Price Range Logic**
**Problem**: The price range selection logic was doing exact string matching instead of checking if the start time falls within the range.

**Location**: `server/routes/bookings.js` lines 28-36

**Fix**: Updated the logic to properly check time ranges:
```javascript
// Before
const slot = ground.price.ranges.find(r => r.start === timeSlot.startTime);

// After
const startHour = parseInt(timeSlot.startTime.split(':')[0]);
const slot = ground.price.ranges.find(r => {
  const rangeStart = parseInt(r.start.split(':')[0]);
  const rangeEnd = parseInt(r.end.split(':')[0]);
  
  // Handle overnight ranges (e.g., 18:00-06:00)
  if (rangeStart > rangeEnd) {
    return startHour >= rangeStart || startHour < rangeEnd;
  } else {
    return startHour >= rangeStart && startHour < rangeEnd;
  }
});
```

### 3. **Incorrect Booking Status After Payment**
**Problem**: After successful payment verification, the booking status was set to "pending" instead of "confirmed".

**Location**: `server/routes/payments.js` lines 225-227

**Fix**: Updated to set correct status and add confirmation details:
```javascript
// Before
booking.status = "pending";
booking.confirmation = undefined;

// After
booking.status = "confirmed";
booking.confirmation = {
  confirmedAt: new Date(),
  confirmationCode: `BC${Date.now().toString().slice(-6)}`,
  confirmedBy: "system"
};
```
