# Booking Logic Fixes Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Schema Mismatch in Booking Model ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: The Booking model schema expected a `taxes` field, but the booking creation code was saving `convenienceFee`.

**Files Modified**:
- `server/routes/bookings.js`
- `src/components/PaymentModal.tsx`

**Changes Made**:
- Updated `getPricing()` function to return `taxes` instead of `convenienceFee`
- Updated booking creation to save `taxes` field instead of `convenienceFee`
- Updated frontend PaymentModal to use `taxes` consistently

### 2. Frontend Component Issues ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: PaymentModal component was using `convenienceFee` instead of `taxes` field.

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/PaymentModal.tsx`

**Changes Made**:
- Updated interface to use `taxes` instead of `convenienceFee`
- Updated all references in the component to use `taxes`
- Fixed duplicate identifier issues in the interface

### 3. Pricing Calculation Consistency ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Inconsistent field naming between backend and frontend.

**Files Modified**:
- `server/routes/bookings.js`
- `src/components/PaymentModal.tsx`

**Changes Made**:
- Ensured all pricing calculations use `taxes` field consistently
- Updated console.log statements to reflect correct field names
- Fixed destructuring assignments to use correct field names

## Booking Logic Flow

### 1. Booking Creation Process
1. **Validation**: 
   - Ground ID validation (MongoDB ObjectId)
   - Required fields validation
   - Player details validation
   - Time slot format validation
   - Booking date validation
   - Time slot for today validation

2. **Ground Lookup**:
   - First tries MongoDB
   - Falls back to fallback grounds data

3. **Capacity Check**:
   - Validates player count against ground capacity

4. **Overlap Detection**:
   - Checks for existing bookings on same date
   - Uses time range overlap logic
   - Prevents double booking

5. **Pricing Calculation**:
   - Calculates base amount based on duration and per-hour rate
   - Applies price ranges if available
   - Calculates taxes (2% convenience fee)
   - Applies discounts
   - Calculates total amount

6. **Booking Creation**:
   - Generates unique booking ID
   - Creates booking with all validated data
   - Saves to database with proper schema

### 2. Time Slot Validation
- **Format**: HH:MM-HH:MM (e.g., "10:00-12:00")
- **Validation**: Ensures start time is before end time
- **Overlap Detection**: Prevents overlapping bookings
- **Today's Validation**: Prevents booking past time slots for today

### 3. Pricing Structure
```javascript
pricing: {
  baseAmount: number,    // Per hour rate × duration
  discount: number,      // Any applicable discount
  taxes: number,         // 2% convenience fee
  totalAmount: number,   // Final amount after all calculations
  currency: "INR"
}
```

## Testing
