# Cashfree Payment Gateway Fix Instructions

## üö® **CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND & FIXED**

### **Issue 1: Missing Environment Variables**
**Problem:** The `.env` file is empty, so Cashfree credentials are not available to the server.

**Solution:** Add the following to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Database
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://rag123456:rag123456@cluster0.qipvo.mongodb.net/boxcricket?retryWrites=true&w=majority

# JWT Secret
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here_change_in_production

# Cashfree Payment Gateway Configuration
CASHFREE_APP_ID=10273687cc0f80bdee21e4c30d68637201
CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY=cfsk_ma_prod_09c55cbdb72bc613fbf861ab777f8b7b_2bcc3b72
CASHFREE_API_URL=https://api.cashfree.com/pg

# Environment
NODE_ENV=development

# Optional: Use sandbox/test mode for testing
# CASHFREE_MODE=test
```

### **Issue 2: Outdated API Version**
